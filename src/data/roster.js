    bio: "Sin Pudor is a female punk thrash band that, since 2005 (with some breaks over the years), has used its music and performances to challenge established bodily and sexual identities imposed by heteropatriarchal and heterocentrist concepts. This distinctive characteristic is complemented by an antifascist political message. Sin Pudor experiments with fast riffs, double bass drum phrasing, and raspy vocals that reveal diverse influences. The band’s solid, compact, and energetic ensemble, combined with a stage presence that evolves with each concert, attracting various audiences and musical tastes, constitutes one of their strengths."

    bio: "Pretty Average brings a fresh musical perspective to Berlin. Candy sings her songs, her rough smoky voice perfectly backed by the distortion and raw sound that she and Sergi have been developing since relocating to Berlin from Barcelona. They haven't stopped working on their music ever since and have been playing countless concerts in Berlin. In late 2024 the band toured around Europe and will return to stages this summer, playing in underground venues around Europe. In 2024, Francisco Parisi (Minimal Schlager) produced the band for their debut release “All I Wanted”. The band recently recorded their debut full length LP with Ghost Palace Records, where their live performance is reproduced and enhanced. The album is funded by Musicboard Berlin Scholarship 24."

Atmospheric, unfiltered, and unapologetic, Human Gate carves out a bold, unconventional identity in the experimental music scene."

    bio: "Mish Mish is an independent alternative rock duo composed of Aganju on beat machines, guitar and vocals & Dally on bass, loops and vocals. Inspired by the psychedelic sounds of the 1970s, such as the distortions of underground bands from the 1990s, and the various radical and transformative counter-cultural aesthetics. A duo of artists who have been working together since 2014 creating performances, music and videos believing in the power of “do it yourself” and art as a way of life. One of the different and interesting components of Mish Mish is the use of beat machines that are programmed and created for each song. In addition, the compositions, made by both members, also bring within themselves a mixture of their poetic universes."
